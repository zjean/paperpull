"""Show, across every installed PaperPull app, how current your archive is.

The question this answers is not "when did I last run it" but "is there
probably something new waiting". Those are different: a run that only verified
existing files, or that found nothing new, still updates a run timestamp while
telling you nothing about whether a new statement has been issued.

So the primary signal is the date of the NEWEST DOCUMENT you actually hold,
compared against how often that provider issues them. The cadence is measured
from your own history (the median gap between consecutive statements), so
nothing has to be configured per provider, and a provider that switches from
monthly to quarterly corrects itself.

Receipt apps (Amazon, Target, Walmart, Gap) are reported without a due date.
Purchases arrive irregularly, so "you are 40 days overdue" would be noise
rather than information.

Usage:
    python status.py                 table for every install under this folder
    python status.py --root PATH     look somewhere else
    python status.py --html          also write status.html next to the installs
    python status.py --quiet         only show what needs attention

It also reports periods that look missing from the MIDDLE of a history, which
a "are you up to date" check cannot see. See find_gaps for why that matters and
how false alarms are kept out.

PRIVACY: this reads local state files only, never document contents, and
reports no amounts or balances. It does name which providers you hold accounts
with, and the gap report names the account labels the apps recorded, which can
include an account nickname and its last four digits. status.html is written
beside the archives, where the documents themselves already live, and never
into the source repo.

    This is the failure this project keeps hitting. An archive can look

    history, and a payroll archive silently defaulted to year to date. Both had
    a recent newest document, so no "are you up to date" check would notice.

    The hard part is not finding gaps, it is not inventing them. Real archives
    contain series that are genuinely irregular, insurance ID cards and policy
    renewals among them, where a long gap means nothing was issued rather than
    something was missed. Flagging those would train you to ignore the report.

    So each series has to earn an opinion first:
      * it is a statement archive, not receipts, whose timing is meaningless
      * at least six documents, so there is a rhythm to compare against
      * a median interval of ten days or more
      * at least 65 percent of its intervals close to that median, which is
        what separates a monthly statement from an occasional notice

    Only then is an interval roughly twice the usual one reported, and it is
    reported as possible rather than certain. A month with no activity can
    legitimately produce no statement.
