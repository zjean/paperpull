# Providers

The running list of what PaperPull supports — and what people want next. The
goal is an ever-growing set covering the banks, cards, brokerages, utilities,
telecoms, payroll systems, and retailers real people actually use.

- **Have an account with a provider that's not here?** You're the ideal person
  to add it — see **[Adding a provider](docs/adding-a-provider.md)**.
- **Want a provider but can't build it?** Open a
  [provider request](https://github.com/rheeloaded/paperpull/issues/new/choose)
  so someone with that account can pick it up.

## Requested / in progress

Anyone can add a row (via a [provider request](https://github.com/rheeloaded/paperpull/issues/new/choose)
or a PR). Claim one by commenting on its issue so two people don't build the
same thing. When it merges, it moves up to **Supported**.

New to this? Look for the **`good first provider`** label — those are easy sites
(a plain statements table + a real download link). See
[Which provider is a good first build?](docs/adding-a-provider.md#which-provider-is-a-good-first-build)

| Provider | Category | Requested by | Status |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| _(none yet — add yours)_ | | | |

Status legend: **requested** → **claimed** (someone's building it) →
**in review** (PR open) → merged (moves to Supported).

## How the list grows

1. **Request** — someone opens a provider request (or adds a row here).
2. **Claim** — a contributor with that account comments to claim it.
3. **Build** — follow [Adding a provider](docs/adding-a-provider.md): clone the
   closest app, rewrite its `*_site.py`, keep it read-only, test the pilot.
4. **PR** — open a pull request (the template has a safety + privacy checklist).
5. **Merge** — it graduates to the Supported table above.

Providers change their sites over time; a supported app that breaks is a
**patch** fix to that app's `*_site.py`, not a rebuild — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
