**Receipt & Statement Downloader** — a family of small, **read-only** tools that log in *alongside you* to your own
accounts and download your **statements and receipts** as PDFs — so you can
archive them (e.g. into [paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)) instead
of clicking through each site by hand.

Runs on **Windows and macOS** (and Linux), with the same commands on each.

Sixteen providers are supported today, all built on the same pattern:

| App | Provider | Documents | Notes |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------|
| [`ally`](apps/ally) | Ally Bank | Account statements, tax forms | JSON API; same-dated statements named from the PDF |
| [`amazon`](apps/amazon) | Amazon | Order invoices (full history) | Per-year order pagination |
| [`amex`](apps/amex) | American Express | Statements, Year-End Summary | Click-nav SPA; in-memory session |
| [`chase`](apps/chase) | Chase (credit cards) | Card statements | Real Edge/Chrome; per-card accordions + year picker |
| [`dominion`](apps/dominion) | Dominion Energy (VA) | Billing statements | Paginated MUI accordion; ~18-month limit |
| [`gap`](apps/gap) | Gap Inc. (Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta) | Order receipts | Lazy-loading history; ~13-month limit |
| [`navyfederal`](apps/navyfederal) | Navy Federal CU | Account statements | Per-account accordions; blob-tab PDFs |
| [`redcard`](apps/redcard) | Target RedCard / Circle Card (TD Bank) | Billing statements | Statements table; per-year switcher |
| [`robinhood`](apps/robinhood) | Robinhood | Account statements, tax docs | "View More" pagination |
| [`target`](apps/target) | Target | Receipts (Online + In-Store) | Print-capture |
| [`tmobile`](apps/tmobile) | T-Mobile | Bill statements | Bill-history page; detailed-bill download |
| [`ukg`](apps/ukg) | UKG Pro / UltiPro | **Pay statements** | Per-employer tenant; JSON-API, nothing clicked |
| [`usaa`](apps/usaa) | USAA | Statements | JSON-API enumeration |
| [`verizon`](apps/verizon) | Verizon (Fios) | Bill statements | Real Edge (bot block); dropdown + CDP download |
| [`walmart`](apps/walmart) | Walmart | Receipts | Hardened against bot detection |
| [`wealthfront`](apps/wealthfront) | Wealthfront | Statements, tax docs | |

## How it works (the shared design)

### The one decision everything follows from

Your documents live on the provider's site, and it will only hand them to a
browser that is already signed in. So PaperPull never tries to *be* you — it
works *beside* you. You sign in yourself, in a real browser window, and the
tool attaches to that window afterwards and reads.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    you(["You"]) -->|"sign in · 2FA · device approval"| br["A real browser window<br/>its own profile · its own debugging port"]
    br -.->|"attaches over CDP — reads, never authenticates"| app
    subgraph app ["One app = one provider"]
        orch["Orchestrator<br/>discover → download → verify<br/>the same in all sixteen apps"]
        site["provider_site.py<br/>selectors · URLs · download quirks"]
        core["paperpull-core<br/>naming · filing · state · CSV · PDF checks"]
        orch --> site
        orch --> core
    end
    app --> out[("Your folders<br/>PDFs + an index CSV")]
```

That single choice is why there is no password anywhere in this project, why
2FA and device approvals are never an obstacle, and why a provider tightening
its login breaks nothing here.

In practice that first step is `login.bat` (or `./login.command`), which opens
the browser for you — a plain Chromium for most apps, or your own installed
Edge/Chrome for the few sites whose bot detection turns a fresh Chromium away
(Walmart, Verizon). Each app gets its own profile and its own debugging port,
so several signed-in browsers can sit open at once without colliding.

**Everything a provider knows lives in one file.** `provider_site.py` holds
every selector, URL and download quirk for that site. The orchestrator around
it is the same in all sixteen apps, and `paperpull-core` underneath it is
shared. When a provider redesigns, the repair is one file — never a rewrite,
and never a change to how documents get named, filed or tracked.

### What one run actually does

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    D["Discover<br/>list what the provider still has"] --> Q{"Already downloaded?"}
    Q -->|yes| S["Skip it"]
    Q -->|no| DL["Download the PDF"]
    DL --> V{"Is it a real PDF?"}
    V -->|no| MR["Manual Review<br/>flagged, never silently lost"]
    V -->|yes| F["Classify, name, file<br/>+ append to the index CSV"]
    F --> OK["Mark downloaded_ok<br/>sticky — survives deletion"]
```

Three plain-text files carry the state, and you can read all of them:

| File | Holds |
|------|-------|
| `discovery.json` | what the provider showed us this run |
| `progress.json` | what happened to each document — including the sticky `downloaded_ok` |
| `<Provider> Index.csv` | one row per saved document, for humans and spreadsheets |

That last step is what makes a re-run safe. `downloaded_ok` is keyed to the
document, not to the file on disk — so you can import everything into
paperless-ngx, delete the PDFs, and the next run still skips them. It only
fetches what is genuinely new, and lists it in `new-this-run.txt`.

### Read-only by construction

Nothing that buys, sells, transfers, pays, deletes, or changes a setting is
ever clicked, and all site interaction lives in `provider_site.py` where it can
be read in one sitting. The statement apps enforce this deny-by-default — a
control must clear a blocklist (`FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE`) *and* match a document
allowlist (`SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE`). The receipt apps screen a narrow
print/invoice pattern against the blocklist. Gap and UKG click nothing at all.
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) spells out which app does which.

### One app, more than one person

A `--config config.<name>.json` flag lets one app serve a second person's
account with its own profile, port and output folders, so no data mixes. The
launchers take the account label as an argument (`login.bat spouse` /
`./login.command spouse`).

## Run it in Docker

**This fork's supported path.** The control panel becomes a web UI you reach
from any device, and the sign-in browser becomes a real Google Chrome with a
web desktop in its own container. You still sign in yourself; PaperPull still
attaches afterwards over the DevTools protocol and never sees a password.

```bash
cp .env.example .env         # set BROWSER_PASSWORD and PAPERPULL_ALLOWED_HOSTS
docker network create proxy  # if your reverse proxy doesn't have one
docker compose up -d
```

Then add the two blocks from [`docker/Caddyfile.example`](docker/Caddyfile.example)
to your Caddyfile, sign in to a provider on the browser desktop, and drive it
from the panel. Full setup, the four Chrome/Playwright gotchas the design works
around, and how to verify it: **[docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md)**.

Images publish from CI: `:latest` from `main`, `:beta` from `develop`.

```

```

This fork tracks [rheeloaded/paperpull](https://github.com/rheeloaded/paperpull)
for new providers — see [docs/upstream.md](docs/upstream.md).

## Quick start (native)

> The `.bat` / `.command` launchers below are upstream's, and still work, but
> are **unmaintained in this fork**. Docker is the supported path.


![Quick start](docs/quickstart.gif)

**One-shot setup** (creates a venv for every app + the GUI, installs the browser):

```bat
setup-all.bat        REM Windows
```

```bash
./setup-all.command  # macOS / Linux
```

Then either drive everything from the **[GUI control panel](gui)** — pick an
app and account, click an action, and watch the live output:

```bat
gui\run_gui.bat
```

![PaperPull control panel](docs/control-panel.gif)

…or run a single app directly (using `amex` as the example):

```bat
cd apps\amex
copy config.example.json config.json    REM then edit paths as needed
login.bat                 REM opens Chromium — sign in yourself, leave it OPEN
run_pilot.bat             REM download the newest few as a test
run_all.bat               REM download everything available
```

Each app also has its own README with provider-specific details and quirks.
(Prefer to set apps up one at a time? Each has its own `setup.bat` / `setup.command`.)

## Windows and macOS

One download covers both. Every app ships two launchers with the same names
and the same behaviour — `.bat` for Windows, `.command` for macOS and Linux —
so the instructions in this README and in each app's own README apply
wherever you are:

| Task | Windows | macOS / Linux |
|------|---------|---------------|
| One-shot setup | `setup-all.bat` | `./setup-all.command` |
| Set up one app | `setup.bat` | `./setup.command` |
| Sign in | `login.bat` | `./login.command` |
| Test run | `run_pilot.bat` | `./run_pilot.command` |
| Full run | `run_all.bat` | `./run_all.command` |
| Control panel | `gui\run_gui.bat` | `gui/run_gui.command` |

A second account is the same on both: `run_all.bat spouse` /
`./run_all.command spouse`.

Only one thing genuinely differs. macOS keeps Playwright's browser inside an
app bundle and in a different cache directory, and a couple of providers need
a branded Edge/Chrome to get past their bot protection — that lookup lives in
`paperpull_core.browser` and is handled for you.

### Getting it onto a Mac

**`git clone` is the smoothest route** — it preserves the scripts' executable
bit and macOS does not quarantine it.

If you download a release archive instead, prefer the **`.tar.gz`**: it keeps
the executable bit, while a `.zip` drops it. After unpacking a download,
macOS may also quarantine the scripts, so a double-click reports *"cannot be
opened because it is from an unidentified developer."* Both are cleared in one
go:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine .
chmod +x setup-all.command apps/*/*.command gui/*.command
```

## Requirements

- **Windows, macOS, or Linux**
- Python 3.11+
- Playwright (installed per app by the setup script)

## Contributing — add your provider

No one has accounts everywhere, so **PaperPull grows when people add the
providers they use.** If a bank, card, brokerage, utility, telecom, or retailer
you use isn't here yet, you're the ideal person to add it:

- 📖 **[Adding a provider](docs/adding-a-provider.md)** — a step-by-step guide
  (clone the closest app, rewrite one file, stay read-only, test, submit).
- 📋 **[PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md)** — what's supported and what's requested;
  claim one so nobody builds it twice.
- 📥 Can't build it yourself? [Request a provider](https://github.com/rheeloaded/paperpull/issues/new/choose)
  and someone with that account may pick it up.

Every contribution keeps the **read-only, local, no-credentials** design — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Status & roadmap

- ✅ All **sixteen** apps work and are in regular use.
- 🔜 **More providers:** community-driven — see [PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md).
- 🔜 **Scheduled/assisted runs:** a monthly "nudge + sweep" (e.g. the 1st) that
  opens the login browsers and then runs discover + resume across every app once
  you've signed in — delete-safe, so it only grabs what's new. Fully unattended
  runs stay out of scope by design: the tools never store credentials or bypass
  2FA, so a human sign-in stays in the loop (long-session retailer apps may
  tolerate more automation than banks/cards).
- ✅ **Shared core:** the support code the apps used to duplicate now lives once
  in [`core/`](core) as `paperpull-core`. An app declares an `AppSpec` — its
  folders, routing, CSV columns and config defaults — and keeps only its
  orchestrator and its `*_site.py`. `tools/check_installs.py` reports whether
  your installs have drifted from the repo.
