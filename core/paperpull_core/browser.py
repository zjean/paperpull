"""Finding and launching the sign-in browser, on whichever OS you are using.

Every app opens the same kind of window: an ordinary browser, on this app's
own debugging port, using this app's own profile directory, which *you* then
sign into. The tool later attaches to it over the DevTools protocol. Nothing
here automates a login.

Two flavours:

* Most providers are happy with the Chromium that Playwright installs.
* A few (Walmart, Verizon) run bot protection that fingerprints that build as
  automation and shows a "robot or human" wall on loop. Those pass far more
  reliably in a real, branded browser, so they ask for Edge or Chrome first
  and fall back to Chromium.

Windows, macOS and Linux are all supported. The only real difference is where
the browsers live, which is what BROWSERS below records.
