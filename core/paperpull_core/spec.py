"""What makes one PaperPull app different from another.

Every app used to carry its own ~430-line copy of `storage.py` and friends.
Comparing those copies showed they were 94-100% identical once the provider's
name was normalised away; the real differences were always the same handful of
*facts*, not logic:

  * the provider's display name,
  * which folders it files documents into, and which of those it actually
    fills (so the rest are only created on demand),
  * how a document routes to a folder,
  * the CSV files it writes and their columns,
  * a few config defaults.

`AppSpec` is that handful of facts. An app declares one; the shared core does
everything else. Adding a provider means writing a spec, not copying a module.

Two families exist and both are first-class:

  RECEIPT apps  route by *purchase type*   ("Online" / "In-Store")
  DOCUMENT apps route by *category*        ("Statement" / "Tax Document" / ...)
