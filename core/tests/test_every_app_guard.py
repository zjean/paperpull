"""Every app's guards, checked in one place.

A repo-wide review found the guards had each drifted their own way. Six apps
defined a guard and never called it, one called it with a hardcoded string so
it always passed, seventeen had no host check at all, and every single one let
settings controls through because only bare verb stems were matched.

Testing this per app let that happen, because each app's tests only ever knew
about that app. These run across all of them at once, so a new provider cannot
quietly ship without the same protection.
