"""ALL Discover selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When Discover changes its site, repair this file only.

SCOPE: Discover **credit cards** only (Discover it, Discover it Miles/Chrome/
Student, Discover More). Discover Bank deposit accounts, personal loans,
student loans and home loans are separate portals and are out of scope.

SAFETY (this is a credit-card account):
  This module is strictly READ-ONLY. It opens the statements/documents area,
  reads the list of documents, and downloads the PDFs Discover already
  generated. It must NEVER activate any control that pays a bill, sets up
  autopay, moves money, transfers a balance, takes a cash advance, redeems
  Cashback Bonus or rewards, freezes or replaces a card, requests a
  credit-line increase, disputes a charge, applies for a product, or changes
  any setting. The guard is FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE; every click path checks it,
  and a control must ALSO look like a document action (SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE)
  before it may be clicked. Dropdowns are controls too - see
  MONEY_CONTROL_RE - and there is deliberately no code here that submits a
  form or confirms a dialog.

A REAL BROWSER, ALWAYS: this app asks for an installed Edge or Chrome
(prefer_real=True), like the Walmart, Verizon and Chase apps. Discover's
bot-detection posture has not been measured, and that is precisely the reason:
a tripped check on a card account can mean a step-up verification loop or a
temporary lock, so the first contact is never from an obviously-automated
browser. Do not "just try" the bundled Chromium to find out.

WHAT THE LIVE PROBE ESTABLISHED (2026-08-19):
  * The page is "Activity & Statements" at
      card.discover.com/cardmembersvcs/statements/app/activity
    hash-routed: #/recent, #/current, #/stmt_YYYYMMDD. page.goto WORKS and
    keeps the session, so this app pastes the URL first - the opposite of the
    Ally and Chase apps, where only clicking the app's own nav worked.
  * There is NO <select> anywhere. The "Show me" period chooser is a
    link-based dropdown, which is why a select-based lookup finds nothing.
  * It does not need to be opened. Every period's row, each with its own PDF
    link, is already in the DOM on plain page load (24 links before any
    interaction, the same 24 after opening the chooser). Discovery is
    therefore ONE READ with nothing clicked and nothing swept - no accordions
    and no per-year sweep, which is all the Chase app's machinery existed for.
  * A statement is served directly:
        GET /cardmembersvcs/statements/app/stmtPDF?view=true&date=YYYYMMDD
          -> 200 application/pdf
             content-disposition: inline;
               filename=Discover-Statement-20250115-1234.pdf
    where date is the statement's CLOSING date. The bytes are fetched with the
    context's own cookies, using the href READ FROM THE PAGE - not a URL built
    from a template, so a change to the query string cannot silently fetch the
    wrong period. The served filename also carries the card's last four, which
    is the only place a single-card login states them.
  * The neighbouring "Download" control opens a MODAL DIALOG (a transactions
    export, not the statement PDF), and "Print" opens a popup. Neither is used:
    answering a dialog is exactly what this project never does.
  * History observed: 24 statements, the oldest .. the newest - about two
    years. Older statements are not reachable from this page and are not
    guessed at.
  * Discover shows an inactivity "stay logged in?" modal; only its keep-alive
    control is ever clicked (dismiss_timeout).

STILL UNVERIFIED:
  * A login with MORE THAN ONE Discover card. This account has one, so no card
    chooser was observed and none is coded for. If one exists, the last four in
    each served filename is the handle to tell statements apart - do not infer
    a card from row position. Attributing by position rather than by what the
    document itself says filed one card's statements under another during the
    Chase build, and the output looked entirely plausible.
  * Whether Discover blocks the bundled Chromium. This app uses a real browser
    regardless; see above.

OUT OF SCOPE: tax documents. Discover Bank issues 1099-INT for deposit
accounts, which this app does not cover; a card account's only tax-ish
document is an occasional 1099-C or 1099-MISC. `document_types` in config
lists Statement only, so a stray one is classified and then skipped rather
than half-filed.

# of a URL the page published). This is NOT the "synthesise an endpoint" move
# that failed on Ally: that guessed a URL and needed an Authorization header
# the SPA added in JavaScript. Here the href is read from the DOM and used
# verbatim.
#
# Not clicking is also what keeps this read-only in the strongest sense: the
# "Download" control next to it opens a MODAL DIALOG (a transactions export,
# not the statement), and answering a dialog is exactly what this project
# never does.

# with hash routes #/recent, #/current and #/stmt_YYYYMMDD. page.goto works
# and keeps the session (unlike Ally and Chase, where it did not).
#
# The page's "Show me" period chooser is a link-based dropdown, NOT a <select>
# - which is why a select-based lookup finds nothing here. It does not need to
# be opened: every period's row, each with its own PDF link, is already in the
# DOM on plain page load. Verified: 24 links before any interaction, the same
# 24 after opening the chooser.
#
# So discovery is one read of
#     a[href*="stmtPDF"]   ->  ...stmtPDF?view=true&date=YYYYMMDD
# where the date is the statement's CLOSING date, and the enclosing <li> gives
# the human period label ("Mar 16 - Apr 15, 2025", or "Current (...)").
#
# Nothing is clicked, no accordion is expanded, no period is swept. The Chase
# app needed all of that because its rows only existed while one card's
# accordion was open on one year; here the whole index is static markup.
#
# History observed: 24 statements, the oldest .. the newest - Discover keeps
# about two years online. Older ones are not reachable from this page and are
