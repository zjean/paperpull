"""ALL Ally Bank selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When Ally changes its site, repair this file only.

SAFETY (this is a BANK):
  This module is strictly READ-ONLY. It navigates to the document/statement
  areas, reads a list of documents, and downloads the PDFs Ally already
  generated. It must NEVER activate any control that moves money, pays a
  bill, sends Zelle/wire/transfer, deposits, withdraws, opens or closes an
  account, renews or rolls over a CD, or changes any setting. The guard is
  FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE; every click path checks it, and a control must ALSO
  look like a document action (SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE) before it may be clicked.
  There is deliberately no code here that submits a form or confirms a dialog.

SCOPE: Ally **Bank** only (checking / savings / money market / CDs). Ally
Invest and Ally Auto are separate portals and are not covered here.

WHAT THE LIVE PROBE ESTABLISHED (2026-08-18):
  * The documents area is https://secure.ally.com/bank/statements-and-forms,
    reached by clicking the SPA's own "Documents" nav control. The dashboard
    is hash-routed and IGNORES a pasted #/statements fragment - a goto leaves
    you on Snapshot, where the only account dropdown belongs to a money
    TRANSFER widget. Hence nav-first navigation, and the dropdown guard.
  * Statements come from
        GET /acs/v1/bank-statements?docType=STATEMENTS&year=YYYY
    answering {"statements":[{iraType, documentId, trustName, documentName,
    uploadDate}]}. That is the discovery path; row scraping is the fallback.
    Driving the year picker 2020..2026 returned 198 statements over 7 years.
  * SEVERAL statements share a date (3/month on this account), and the record
    carries NOTHING that separates them except documentId:
      - trustName is present on only some records, and it really is a TRUST
        name - the page renders those rows as "<name> Trust Statement".
      - documentName is always "Statement"; iraType is always false.
      - the remaining records are described identically in the API AND on the
        page ("Download statement for: Statement"), several per date.
    So a trust statement can be identified exactly, and the rest can only be
    told apart by POSITION within their date. Discovery numbers them
    (`occurrence`) and flags them (`ambiguous`); the downloader aims at the
    Nth such row and returns False rather than guessing. Which real account
    each belongs to is not knowable from the site - only from the PDF.
  * The page has a year picker (select#statementYear) covering 2020..2026.

DOWNLOAD: clicking the row's control opens the PDF in a new tab, whose bytes
are captured. Fetching /acs/v1/bank-statements/<documentId> directly does NOT
work - it needs the Authorization header the SPA adds in JS. That endpoint is
still useful as PROOF: the id in the request says which statement was really
served, so a download is verified rather than trusted (see ally_download).

TAX FORMS (confirmed live 2026-08-18): a "Tax Forms" tab at
/bank/statements-and-forms/tax, served by the SAME endpoint with
    GET /acs/v1/bank-statements?docType=TAXFORMS      (no year parameter)
answering {"taxForms":[{corrected, documentId, documentName, iraType, taxYear,
trustName, uploadDate}]}. Notes that cost real debugging:
  * File by taxYear, NOT uploadDate: the 2025 form is posted 2026-01-10.
  * The row names the form "1099-INT" while the API titles it "Form 1099-INT",
    so rows are matched on the form CODE (FORM_CODE_RE).
  * One form per registration per year, ALL titled identically - matching on
    the name alone served the same PDF twice (the served-id check caught it,
    reporting the id asked for against the id returned). Registration first,
    then position.
  * The tax year picker starts at 2020, but the API returns a 2019 form. That
    document cannot be reached from the page at all; the app says so and stops
    rather than downloading a different year.

# docType parameter (docType=STATEMENTS), which all but names a sibling value

# own tax tab and captures whatever request the SPA makes - so it keeps working
# if Ally renames the parameter, and it never invents a URL.
#
# The payload shape is read tolerantly for the same reason: the list is found
# by looking for the array in the response, and each record's id/name/date by
# trying the key names Ally is known to use. Anything unrecognised is skipped
# and logged rather than guessed at.
