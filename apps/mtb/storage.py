"""What makes the M&T Bank app different - everything else is paperpull_core.

This file used to be a full copy of the storage logic every other app carried.
That logic now lives in `paperpull_core`; what remains here is M&T Bank's own
facts: the folders it files into, how a document routes to one, its CSV
columns, and its config defaults.

To repair M&T Bank's *page* behaviour, edit `mtb_site.py` instead.
