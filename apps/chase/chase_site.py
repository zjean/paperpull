"""ALL Chase selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When Chase changes its site, repair this file only.

SCOPE: Chase **credit cards** only. Deposit accounts, mortgages, auto loans
and J.P. Morgan investment accounts are out of scope for this app.

SAFETY (this is a credit-card account):
  This module is strictly READ-ONLY. It opens the statements/documents area,
  reads the list of documents, and downloads the PDFs Chase already generated.
  It must NEVER activate any control that pays a bill, sets up autopay, moves
  money, transfers a balance, takes a cash advance, redeems rewards or points,
  books travel, requests a credit-line increase, disputes a charge, locks or
  replaces a card, applies for a product, or changes any setting. The guard is
  FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE; every click path checks it, and a control must ALSO
  look like a document action (SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE) before it may be clicked.
  Dropdowns are controls too - see MONEY_CONTROL_RE - and there is deliberately
  no code here that submits a form or confirms a dialog.

A REAL BROWSER, ALWAYS: Chase runs bot protection that fingerprints the
Playwright Chromium build. `cmd_open_browser` asks for an installed Edge or
Chrome (prefer_real=True), like the Walmart and Verizon apps. This is not only
about whether a page loads: a tripped bot check on a bank can mean a step-up
verification loop or a temporary lock on a real account, so nothing here ever
touches Chase from an obviously-automated browser.

WHAT THE LIVE PROBE ESTABLISHED (2026-08-18):
  * The document centre is
      secure.chase.com/web/auth/dashboard#/dashboard/documents/myDocs/index
    reached by clicking the app's own nav; document types are URL segments
    (documentType=STATEMENTS / TAX_DOCUMENTS / YEAR_END_STATEMENTS).
  * The page is ONE ACCORDION PER CARD. Opening one makes the SPA call
      POST /svc/rr/documents/secure/idal/v2/docref/list
           accountFilter=<card>&dateFilter.idalDateFilterType=CURRENT_YEAR[_MINUS_n]
    answering {"idaldocRefs":[{documentId, documentDate (YYYYMMDD),
    documentTypeDesc, idaldocType, pageCount}]}.
  * History comes from the page's "View:" year picker (2019..2026 here). It is
    NOT a <select> but a styled <input id*="filterstyledselect">, which is why
    a select-based lookup finds nothing. Driving it is what makes Chase send
    CURRENT_YEAR_MINUS_n; this app never synthesises a filter value the UI
    would not have sent.
  * Documents are attributed from the ROW, not from the API reply. Every row
    names itself in full - "Aug 09, 2026 Statement SAPPHIRE RESERVE (...1234)
    Saves document" - so a document can only be filed under the card printed
    on it. Correlating async replies instead put one card's statements under
    another: collapsing, expanding and changing the year all hit the same
    endpoint, so "the next reply" is not the reply to this click.
  * A card that is ALREADY expanded never re-fetches, so it must be collapsed
    before being opened, or its documents are silently missed entirely.
  * Downloads fire a real browser download event from the row's "Saves
    document" link.

OUT OF SCOPE: tax documents and year-end summaries. Chase gives both their own
nav entries, and this app deliberately collects neither - `document_types` in
config lists only Statement, so a stray one is skipped rather than half-filed.
Removing them beats shipping a collector that has never worked: the tax code
inherited from the Ally app expected a <select> year picker and could not have
run against Chase's accordions.
