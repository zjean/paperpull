"""ALL Paylocity selectors, URL patterns, and page behavior live here.

When Paylocity changes its site, repair this file only.

STATUS, and read this before trusting anything below.

  CONFIRMED from the public site, 2026-08-22:
    * sign-in is at https://access.paylocity.com with Company ID, Username
      and Password, or a company SSO handoff. OAuth with PKCE underneath.
      The Company ID is typed by the user at sign-in and is never handled,
      stored, or needed by this app.
    * no bot wall was met on the login page, so bundled Chromium is used

  NOT YET CONFIRMED, and deliberately not guessed:
    * where the signed-in portal keeps pay statements, and whether a JSON
      API feeds them the way UKG's mobile API does
    * how a statement PDF is delivered

  There are NO guessed URLs here. The AAFMAA app burned a day on four
  invented page names and the Discover app once ended a live session on a
  logoff page the same way. Discovery starts from the page the user left
  open, and --diagnose records where every link points so the real routes
  can be written in from evidence.

SAFETY (this is a payroll site):
  A payroll portal can change direct deposit, tax withholding, and personal
  details. This module is strictly READ-ONLY. It must NEVER activate a
  control that changes a bank account, routing number, W-4 or withholding,
  address, benefits, time off, or any setting. A control must clear
  FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE *and* match SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE, and every URL this
  app requests must be on Paylocity's own host. There is deliberately no
  code here that submits a form or confirms a dialog.

Sign-in varies per employer, a Paylocity Company ID with username and
password, or corporate SSO with MFA. The tool does not care which. You sign
in, it attaches afterwards. There is no login code here.
