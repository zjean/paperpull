"""ALL DFAS myPay selectors, URLs, and page behavior live here.

When myPay changes, repair this file only.

STATUS, read before trusting anything below.

  CONFIRMED from the public site, 2026-08-23:
    * one host, mypay.dfas.mil, an Angular SPA using #/ fragment routes
    * sign-in is a Login ID + password form (CAC is offered separately)
    * the sign-in page also carries an SSN field (name="socialField") used for
      account recovery, and an "AgreeToTerms" checkbox

  NOT YET CONFIRMED, and deliberately not guessed:
    * where the eRAS, CRSC and tax documents live once signed in
    * how a statement PDF is delivered

  There are NO guessed URLs here. A document is fetched by its (type, id)
  pair, both validated as integers against the type map below, so the request
  path is built from numbers this app recognises rather than from any stored
  string.

SAFETY (this is a US government pay system):
  Strictly READ-ONLY. myPay can change where retirement pay is deposited, tax
  withholding, allotments, SBP elections and correspondence details. This app
  must NEVER activate a control that does any of those, never submits a form,
  never confirms a dialog, and never accepts terms on the user's behalf. It
  also must never read from or type into the SSN field.

  Two further rules specific to a DoD system:
    * the user signs in themselves and accepts the DoD consent banner
      themselves. This app does not click through a government consent banner.
    * sessions are short by design. An expired session raises SessionExpired
      so a run stops loudly rather than reporting an empty success.
