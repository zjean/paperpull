# AAFMAA Document Downloader (local, supervised, READ-ONLY)

Downloads your AAFMAA (Armed Forces Mutual) **premium statements**, **policy
and insurance documents**, and **tax forms** as PDFs, and keeps an index CSV.

Everything runs **locally**. Nothing is sent to any external AI API or
third-party service. You sign in **manually**; the tool never touches your
credentials and never bypasses AAFMAA's 2FA or security checks.

> **Status: verified end to end against a live account (2026-08-22)** by a full
> 60-document run. One caveat: only the default MY DOCUMENTS section is read.
> The Insurance Documents and Digital Vault sections are separate postback
> views and are not discovered yet, so anything held only there will not be
> archived. `diagnose.bat` shows the section links for whoever adds them.

## Read-only by design (this portal can move money)

The Member Center's own front page offers **Pay Premiums**, **Check Loan
Balances**, **Make a Payment**, **Update Family Information** and **Update
Contact Information**. A member can take a policy loan and pay a premium from
here, so read-only is not a nicety.

This tool only reads the document areas and saves PDFs AAFMAA has already
generated. It **never** pays a premium, requests or repays a loan, surrenders
or withdraws value, changes a beneficiary, edits contact or family details,
applies for or cancels coverage, or changes any setting. A control must pass
**two** checks before it may be clicked: it must look like a document action
(`SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE`) *and* match nothing in the blocklist
(`FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE`). Both live in `aafmaa_site.py` and are covered by
tests in `tests/test_doc_types.py`.

One dialog is answered, and it is the only one in this whole project. AAFMAA
shows a disclosure before serving some documents, a checkbox reading "I
confirm that I have read the message above and understand the potential
risk" and a View button. Answering it changes nothing on the account, and
refusing it would mean the archive cannot be built. The app answers it only
when the dialog's id matches, its text contains that sentence, and not one
money-related word appears in it, and a dialog left over from an earlier
document is cleared by reloading rather than answered, since its View button
belongs to a different document. The gate is tested.

## How it connects

`login.bat` opens an ordinary Chromium (debugging port **9238**) that **you**
sign into. The tool then connects to that already-signed-in browser and reads
only the pages you are authorised to see. No stealth, no evasion.

**The signed-in browser window must stay OPEN while the tool runs.**

Port 9238 is this app's alone, so several signed-in browsers can be open at
once without two apps sharing a profile.

## How the site is built

`connect.aafmaa.com` is classic ASP.NET WebForms. Two things follow from that:

- The session is a **server-side cookie**, so navigating straight to a deep
  page keeps you signed in. Unlike the Amex app, nothing is lost on `goto`.
- Many "links" are not links — they are `__doPostBack(...)` handlers on an
  `<a>`, so the href tells you nothing and the control has to be clicked.
  Where a real handler URL with a document id exists, the tool uses that
  instead; clicking a row is the fallback.

## Documents captured

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Statements\` | Premium statements and notices, billing statements, loan statements |
| `Insurance Documents\` | Certificates of insurance, policy documents, coverage summaries |
| `Tax Documents\` | 1099-INT, 1099-R, 1098 and similar (these contain your SSN) |
| `Year-End Summaries\` | Annual statements (created only once one is found) |
| `Other Documents\` | Anything else (only if you widen `document_types`) |
| `Manual Review\` | Files that failed PDF validation |

Filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD AAFMAA <Summary>.pdf`, e.g.
`2026-03-31 AAFMAA Premium Statement.pdf`,
`2025-12-31 AAFMAA Certificate of Insurance.pdf`,
`2025-12-31 AAFMAA 1099-INT Tax Form.pdf`.

Naming rules are in `document_rules.json` (plain regex -> summary, editable,
no code changes needed). Those rules are provisional too — retune them once
you have seen what your account actually calls things.

## Setup / workflow

| Step | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | `setup.bat` | Creates `.venv`, installs Playwright + pypdf, downloads Chromium |
| 2 | `login.bat` | Opens Chromium (port 9238); sign in, open your documents area, **leave open** |
| 3 | `diagnose.bat` | Read-only look at the page structure; downloads nothing |
| 4 | `run_pilot.bat` | 5 newest documents, then **stops** for your inspection |
| 5 | inspect the PDFs/CSV | You approve before anything bigger runs |
| 6 | `run_all.bat` | Everything in scope (asks for `YES`) |
| any time | `resume.bat` | Continue after an interruption; never redoes finished work |
| any time | `verify_documents.bat` | Re-validate every saved PDF |

Filters: `--type "Insurance Document"`, `--year 2025`,
`--start-date 2025-01-01`.

## If a site change breaks it

All the site-specific logic lives in `aafmaa_site.py`. If AAFMAA redesigns its
pages and discovery or download stops working, run `diagnose.bat` after signing
in — it dumps the current page structure to `Diagnostics\` so the selectors can
be updated to match. Nothing else in the app needs to change.

## Sensitive files

Premium statements and especially tax forms can contain your SSN, policy
numbers and coverage amounts. They are saved to the folder you set as
`output_dir` in `config.json` (the default is this app's own folder). Keep it
somewhere safe, and if that folder syncs to a cloud drive, know these
documents go with it. The index CSV deliberately records **no** policy
numbers, coverage amounts, or SSN — only what is needed to find and verify a
file.
