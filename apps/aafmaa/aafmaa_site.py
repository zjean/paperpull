"""ALL AAFMAA (Armed Forces Mutual) selectors, URLs, and page behaviour live here.

When AAFMAA changes its site, repair this file only.

STATUS, and read this before trusting anything below.

  CONFIRMED against a signed-in account, 2026-08-22, by a full 60-document
  run that completed clean:
    * /Documents/default.aspx is the documents area, /<Area>/default.aspx
      the app's shape, and the session an ordinary ASP.NET cookie
    * the table layout, the pager (numeric postback links), the View
      disclosure dialog, and the postback download flow
    * the identity check: every saved statement contained its own row's
      policy number

  STILL UNVERIFIED:
    * the Insurance Documents and Digital Vault SECTIONS. They are postback
      views of this same page, and only the default MY DOCUMENTS view has
      been read. Documents held only in those sections are not discovered
      yet. The section links are visible in diagnose output when someone
      wants to add them.
    * any account shaped differently: one policy, no family members, or a
      table long enough to page past 3
    * document_rules.json against titles other than the ones this account
      shows (Annual Statement, plus the 2019 insurance letters)

  The safety guard does not depend on any of this and applies from the start.

SAFETY (this portal can move money):
  The Member Center's own front page advertises Pay Premiums, Check Loan
  Balances, Make a Payment, Update Family Information and Update Contact
  Information. A member can take a policy loan and pay a premium from here.
  So this module is strictly READ-ONLY: it opens the document areas, reads a
  list, and downloads PDFs AAFMAA has already generated. It must NEVER
  activate a control that pays a premium, requests or repays a loan,
  surrenders or withdraws value, changes a beneficiary, edits contact or
  family details, applies for or cancels coverage, or changes any setting.
  A control must clear FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_RE *and* match SAFE_DOC_CONTROL_RE.

  One dialog is answered, the only one in the project: AAFMAA's disclosure
  ("I confirm that I have read the message above") that stands between the
  View control and some documents. See the block above is_view_disclosure()
  for the gate and the reasoning. Nothing else is ever confirmed.

HOW THIS SITE IS BUILT
  connect.aafmaa.com is classic ASP.NET WebForms - __VIEWSTATE, __EVENTTARGET,
  and control names like ctl00$cphForm$ucLogOn$txtUsername. Two consequences
  shape everything below:

  * The session is a server-side ASP.NET cookie, so `page.goto` to a deep page
    stays signed in. (Contrast the Amex app, whose token lives only in memory
    and dies on navigation.) Navigating by URL is safe here.
  * Many "links" are not links. They are javascript:__doPostBack(...) on an
    <a>, so the href tells you nothing and the control has to be clicked.
    Confirmed for this page: every View and Download control is a postback,
    and no handler URL with a document id exists anywhere. The postback
    target name is therefore the document's identity.

THE TABLE, confirmed 2026-08-22
  Date | Document | Policy | Name of Insured | View in Browser | Download a Copy

  Two controls per row, and the choice between them matters. "Download a
  Copy" posts back to lnkShowDownloadConfirmation, which opens a confirmation
  panel, and answering one is a thing this project does not do anywhere. "View
  in Browser" renders the document directly, so that is the control used.

  Above the member's own rows sit three static PDFs that every member sees, a
  president's letter, a benefits brochure and the privacy policy. They are
  dropped by WHERE they live, under /Resources/PDFFiles/, not by their titles.
  Only one of the three matches any skip rule, so title matching would have
  quietly archived the other two as though they were somebody's records.
